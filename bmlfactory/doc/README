This file provides some information on the beamline factory part of
the MAD parser.


The new files are

bmlfactory.h    - the declaration of the bmlfactory class

bmlfactory.cc   - the definitions of the bmlfactory class methods

bel_inst_fns.c  - functions used to instantiate beamline elements that
                  are used in MAD but do not seem to have analogs in
                  Leo's beamline library

test-factory.cc - defines a main function that performs a simple test
                  of the beamline factory


To use the beamline factory one needs all of the previously written
MAD parser, as well as the new files bmlfactory.h, bmlfactory.cc,
and bel_inst_fns.c.
