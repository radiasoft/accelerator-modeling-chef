I have imported the bmlfactory into the CVS repository.  In doing so,
I started from the files in /home/mokhovd/newparser/madparser and
modified them as follows.


(1) In agreement with the rest of the repository, I split them
    into subdirectories: doc, include, src, and tests.

    doc:     MAD-parser-slides.lyx  manual.tex
    include: *.h
    src:     *.c *.C *.cc mad.lex
    tests:   lattice.mad test-factory.cc mad2cfg.c

(2) I wrote Makefiles for src and tests that work with our
    repository's "make gcc" command. I also added lines to
    fnal/Makefile and fnal/Make-config to incorporate the new
    module. A library is built named libbmlfactory.a.  "make gcc"
    should work, but I have not tried the other possibilities.

(3) I added 

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern "C" {
    #endif

    lines to include/beamel_table.h  madparser.h
                     bml_table.h     expression.h

(4) In include/bmlfactory.h and src/bmlfactory.cc:
    I changed the signature of

    bmlfactory::bmlfactory( char*, double );
    beamline* bmlfactory::create_beamline( char* );

    to

    bmlfactory::bmlfactory( const char*, double );
    beamline* bmlfactory::create_beamline( const char* );

(5) Again in src/bmlfactory.cc: 
    I added 

    double energy;
    energy = PH_CNV_brho_to_p*BRHO_;
    energy = energy*energy + PH_NORM_mp*PH_NORM_mp;
    energy = sqrt( energy );
    lbml->setEnergy( energy );
    
    in the function bmlfactory::beam_line_instantiate
    just above
    
    return lbml;


(6) I separated yywrap.c and included it in libbmlfactory.a.


Other changes will be made in the future: an early one will (probably)
be adding CF_sbend and CF_rbend to the instantiator.  CF_[sr]bend
should be used when MAD declares an [sr]bend with non-zero quad
strength. Right now, the parser just instantiates an [sr]bend, which
is not correct.

Another impending change: monitors with length.

Many thanks to Dmitri and Oleg for putting this together.

Leo
