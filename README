This is a first attempt to make a general dirctory structure for the
accelerator physics C++ class libraries at Fermilab.

The directories are:

The environment variable FNALROOT must be set to the fnal directory.
A 'make setup' will setup the library directories and the proper links
in the include directory.  See the Makefile for details on how to
create the libraries.


	bml      -- An accelerator object class library. This
			was delevoped by Leo Michelotti.

	mxb      -- An automatic differentiation class library This
			was delevoped by Leo Michelotti.

	beamline -- An accelerator object class library. This
			was delevoped by Leo Michelotti.  USE bml INSTTEAD!

	mxyzptlk -- An automatic differentiation class library This
			was delevoped by Leo Michelotti.  USE mxb INSTEAD!

	tev      -- A class library and applications for work with
			the Fermilab Tevatron.

	server   -- A class library and applications for the model server.

	sybase   -- A class libary and aplications for using the Sybase Open 
                        Client Libary.

	socket   -- The socket++ class library.

	tcl      -- A class library and scripts to use tcl with c++.

	mc       -- A class library and applications for beam loss monte carlo.

        filter   -- A group of routines that can be applied to
                        beamlines to modify them.

	recycler -- A class library and applications for work with
			the Fermilab Recycler.

	swyd     -- A class library and applications for work with
			the Fermilab Tevatron and Switchyard beamlines.
