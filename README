This is a first attempt to make a general dirctory structure for the
accelerator physics C++ class libraries at Fermilab.

The directories are:

The enviroment variable FNALROOT must be set to the fnal directory

	beamline -- An accelerator object class library. This
			was delevoped by Leo Michelotti.

	mxyzptlk -- An automatic differentiation class library This
			was delevoped by Leo Michelotti.

	tev      -- A class library and applications for work with
			the Fermilab Tevatron.

	server  -- A class library and applications for the model server

	sybase  -- A class libary and aplications for using the Sybase Open Client
		   Libary

	socket  -- The socket++ class library

	tcl     -- A class library and scripts to use tcl with c++

	mc      -- A class library and applications for beam loss monte carlo



See the Makefile for details on how to create the libraries.
