CHEF (an acronym for Collaborative Hierachical Expansible Framework, 
if you must really know) is being developed at the 
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

CHEF is layered on a set of (C++) class libraries, originally 
authored by Leo Michelotti. In recent years Jean-Francois Ostiguy
made significant contributions. The libraries continue to be 
jointly developed.

basic_toolkit:       Foundations Classes 
mxyzptlk:            A full-featured  automatic differentiation engine
beamline:            Beamline elements, hierarchical beamline containers 
                     and associated operations 
physics_toolkit:     Accelerator Physics related calculations.
bmlfactory:          parsing 
 
Enrico Ng (as a summer intern) helped putting together the 
automated build system. 

Jim Amundson contributed a series of python-based tests.

MAD format parsing is provided by the bmlfactory class library. 
A parser based on Lex/Yacc was authored by Dmitri Mokhov 
(a summer intern now working for Intel Corp.) and Oleg  Krivosheev 
(then a Post Doc, now working in the medical instruments industry). 
Many bug fixes and improvements were contributed by 
Jean-Francois Ostiguy. Recently, a new XSIF parser (MAD8 + support 
for linacs) was added and will likely supersede the old one. 

The authors would also like to acknowledge contributions from many 
people, incluing James Holt, Elliot McCrory, Andrew Braun, Jim Amundson, 
Mike Martens, and Paul Lebrun, who  exercised the libraries in various 
contexts, identified bugs, helped diagnose inefficiencies 
and shortcomings and suggested and/or contributed improvements. 

Finally, the authors would like to express their gratitute to
the management of the Accelerator and Computing Divisions 
for their continued support.
