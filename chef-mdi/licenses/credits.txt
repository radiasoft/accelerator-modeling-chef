CHEF (an acronym for Collaborative Hierarchical Expansible Framework, 
if you must really know) is being developed at the 
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

CHEF (the application) depends on a set of (C++) class libraries 
initially authored by Leo Michelotti in the 1990s. 
In recent years, Jean-Francois Ostiguy made major contributions 
and the original code went through a series of in-depth revisions.  
The libraries are now developed jointly. They include:

basic_toolkit:       Foundations Classes 
mxyzptlk:            A full-featured  automatic differentiation engine
beamline:            Beamline elements, hierarchical beamline containers 
                     and associated operations 
physics_toolkit:     accelerator physics related calculations.
python-bindings:     a fairly comprehensive set of python bindings for the c++ classes
bmlfactory:          a now somewhat deprecated MAD8 parser  
parsers:             parsers ( xsif and madx ) 
 
Over the years, many people have contributed code, time and expertise. 
Enrico Ng (as a summer intern) helped putting together an autotools-based 
build system. Jim Amundson contributed a series of python-based unit tests.
The first MAD8 format parser (bmlfactory) was developed by Dmitri Mokhov 
(then a summer intern now with Intel Corp.) and Oleg  Krivosheev 
(then a Post Doc, now working in the medical instruments industry).

James Holt, Elliot McCrory, Andrew Braun, Jim Amundson, 
Mike Martens and Paul Lebrun, either used or tested the libraries 
in various contexts, identified many bugs, helped diagnose 
inefficiencies and shortcomings and suggested and contributed 
improvements. 

The authors would like to express their gratitude 
to Fermilab management for continued support.
