CHEF (an acronym for Collaborative Hierachical Expansible Framework, 
if you must really know) is being developed at the Fermi National 
Accelerator Laboratory in the Accelerator Integration Department. 
The authors are 

Leo Michelotti            michelotti@fnal.gov
Jean-Francois Ostiguy        ostiguy@fnal.gov

working under the supervision of 

Valeri Lebedev                   val@fnal.gov

CHEF is layered on a set of (C++) class libraries, authored by 
Leo Michelotti:

basic_toolkit:       foundations classes (e.g linear algebra, lists etc)
mxyzptlk:            automatic differentiation
beamline:            beamline elements, hierarchical beamline containers 
                     and associated operations 
physics_toolkit:     Accelerator Physics related calculations.
aesop:               not really a library, but an early application. 
                     Some of its widgets have been reused. 
 
Over the years various people, including Jean-Francois Ostiguy, 
Elliot McCrory,  James Holt and Andrew Braun exercised the libraries 
in various contexts, identified bugs, helped diagnose inefficiencies 
and shortcomings, suggested and implemented improvements. 
Jean-Francois Ostiguy with the help of Enrico Ng (as a summer intern) 
put together an automated build system. 

MAD format parsing is provided by the bmlfactory class library. 
The parser is based on Lex/Yacc and was authored by Dmitri Mokhov 
(a summer intern now working for Intel Corp.) and Oleg  Krivosheev 
(then a Post Doc, now working in the medical instruments industry). 
Various improvements were contributed by Jean-Francois Ostiguy, 
including fixes for memory leaks.  

Jim Amundson (CD) diagnosed and provided a fix for a long 
standing bug in the yacc grammar definition. 

The authors would like to thank David McGinnis, 
Associate Division Head for Accelerator Systems and Head of the 
Integration Department for his continued support.
